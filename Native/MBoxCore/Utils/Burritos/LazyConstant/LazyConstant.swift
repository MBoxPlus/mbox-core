/// A property wrapper which delays instantiation until first read access and prevents
/// changing or mutating its wrapped value.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```
/// @Lazy var result = expensiveOperation()
/// ...
/// print(result) // expensiveOperation() is executed at this point
///
/// result = newResult // Compiler error
/// ```
///
/// As an extra on top of `lazy` it offers reseting the wrapper to its "uninitialized" state.
///
/// - Note: This wrapper prevents reassigning the wrapped property value but *NOT* the wrapper itself.
/// Reassigning the wrapper `_value = LazyConstant(initialValue: "Hola!")` is possible and
/// since wrappers themselves need to be declared variable there is no way to prevent it.

    let constructor: () -> Value
    
    /// Creates a constnat lazy property with the closure to be executed to provide an initial value once the wrapped property is first accessed.
    ///
    /// This constructor is automatically used when assigning the initial value of the property, so simply use:
    ///
    ///     @Lazy var text = "Hello, World!"
    ///
