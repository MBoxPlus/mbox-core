/// A property wrapper which delays instantiation until first read access.
///
/// It is a reimplementation of Swift `lazy` modifier using a property wrapper.
/// As an extra on top of `lazy` it offers reseting the wrapper to its "uninitialized" state.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```
/// @Lazy var result = expensiveOperation()
/// ...
/// print(result) // expensiveOperation() is executed at this point
/// ```
///
/// As an extra on top of `lazy` it offers reseting the wrapper to its "uninitialized" state.

    let constructor: () -> Value
    
    /// Creates a lazy property with the closure to be executed to provide an initial value once the wrapped property is first accessed.
    ///
    /// This constructor is automatically used when assigning the initial value of the property, so simply use:
    ///
    ///     @Lazy var text = "Hello, World!"
    ///
